Hello friend, you've found a monorepo!

They're all the rage these days. Everything in the `packages/` directory is its own package on npm. It makes developing a module ecosystem way easier.

If you wanna poke the code, clone this repo and `yarn install` (`npm` won't cut it, this project uses yarn-only features).
