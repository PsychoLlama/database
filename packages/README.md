Hello friend, you've found a monorepo!

They're all the rage these days. Everything in the `packages/` directory is its own package on npm. It makes developing a module ecosystem way easier.

Everything's managed by [`lerna`](https://github.com/lerna/lerna), a super great command line tool made by the cool people at Babel.

If you wanna poke the code, clone this repo and `npm install` (or `yarn install`, that's cool too). The lerna stuff should be pretty invisible.
